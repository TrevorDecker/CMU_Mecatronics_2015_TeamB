# System Requirements #

Although the robot has no required start position, it must be able to clear randomly applied dirt or streaking for a window, with a solid frame, within the range of 3’x4’ to 5’x6’. Some of the other mandatory requirement include the following:

  - 100% coverage with speed greater than or equal to 10 ft2/min
  - 2 ft2 footprint when retracted, if applicable, with any aspect ratio
  - cannot be supported from the ground
  - no external structure can be installed other than a pneumatic compressor

Success will be based on visual inspection 3 feet away with no streaking or residual moisture 30 seconds after washing is complete. The “coolness factor” that our group is aiming to accomplish is cleaning multiple windows. We believe that this is important to accomplish in order for our robot to have a real-world application.
