## System Performance ##

#Gripper Test#
   A quick test was run to figure out how much weight our current gripper prototype could support.  A clamp was attached to the gripper and a bag was hung off of the clamp at the distance that we expect the center of mass of the robot to be away from the window.  Weight was added to the bag until failure, which occured at around 5 lbs. Currently, we are leaning towards using the weight of the robot to hold onto the frame. The proposed way to accomplish this is by clasping on with a C-clamp and allowing for the top and bottom of the clamp to apply normal forces to the frame.

#Extending Unit#
   The extension arm has been built and has been tested. The lead screw is able to power the extending arm quickly as long as there is enough current from the power supply. Due to the length of the lead screw, we are concerned about the binding of the lead screw. There are also some concerns regarding the weight of the arm but due to the transfer gearbox but we will attempt to cut down on the weight in a way that would not compromise function.

#Pivoting Unit#
The pivoting motion is dictated by a gearbox with a worm gear. It has been assembled and is in the process of being tested. From testing the pivoting unit, we understood the importance of material selection and failure modes. At first, we made the spacers out of acrylic which yielded under the stress of the turning gear. The next step is to make new spacers of a larger radius out of delrin or alumnium to withstand the stresses. This improvement will allow us to continue testing.

#Cleaning Unit#
The cleaning unit is currently being built and undergoing testing. We have been testing the fit of various components on the cleaning unit and soon the whole cleaning unit can be printed and tested. One cleaning unit for the extending arm was printed and we successfully got it to slide smoothly on the extension arm. Since the power chain needs to be wound up on both ends, we will need to design a housing to keep the chain compact.
