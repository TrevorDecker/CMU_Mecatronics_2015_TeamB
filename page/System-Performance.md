## System Performance ##

#Gripper Test#
   A quick test was run to figure out how much weight our current gripper prototype could support.  A clamp was attached to the gripper and a bag was hung off of the clamp at the distance that we expect the center of mass of the robot to be away from the window.  Weight was added to the bag until failure, which occured at around 5 lbs. Currently, we are leaning towards using the weight of the robot to hold onto the frame. The proposed way to accomplish this is by clasping on with a C-clamp and allowing for the top and bottom of the clamp to apply normal forces to the frame.

#Extending Unit#
   The extension arm has been built and has been tested. The lead screw is able to power the extending arm quickly as long as there is enough current from the power supply. Due to the length of the lead screw, we are concerned about the binding of the lead screw. There are also some concerns regarding the weight of the arm but due to the transfer gearbox but we will attempt to cut down on the weight in a way that would not compromise function.
