# The Challenge #

Every year, window cleaners suffer injuries from slipping on soap or water and falling from large heights. We have a solution! For the Window Washer project, our task is to design and prototype a robot that can automatically clean one side of a plexiglass window without scratching or damaging the surface. As a team, we wish to create a compact robot that will be able to clean multiple adjacent windows effectively and efficiently. Intrigued? Keep reading to see how we are accomplishing our goals of saving window cleaners from workplace hazards!

The goal of the Window Washer is to automatically clean one side of a glass or plexiglass window without scratching or 
damaging the surface. The robot has to accommodate any window size within the range of 3’x4’ to 5’x6’ with a solid frame. 
The robot has no required start position but the robot must be able to clear randomly applied dirt or streaking. Some of 
the other mandatory requirement include the following:

* 100% coverage with speed greater than or equal to 10 ft2/min
* 2 ft2 footprint when retracted, if applicable, with any aspect ratio
* cannot be supported from the ground
* no external structure can be installed other than a pneumatic compressor

Success will be based on visual inspection 3 feet away with no streaking or residual moisture 30 seconds after washing 
is complete. As a team, it was also decided that the robot should be able to move from window to window in order to be able 
to clean multiple adjacent windows.  To do this, the robot must be able to pass over the window frame and continue to clean. 
Ideally, we want our robot to be practical to use on tall buildings.
