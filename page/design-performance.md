# Performance #

It is very important that our system meet or exceed the design requirements. We will be measuring the system as a whole, but also through a series of prototypes that we build to test good and bad ideas.

## Gripper - First Physical Model ##

[add image]

The first copy of the gripper that we have build was made of laser-cut sheet acrylic. This model was not meant to be structurally sound as this is clearly not a good material choice for tensile strength. We also had issue coupling the threaded rod to a motor correctly since we did not build the connection well. However, this model did help us quickly understand how little gripping area we have and how much loss there is in multiple mechanical connections.
