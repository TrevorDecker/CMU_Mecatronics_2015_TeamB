# Team B: Monkey Bars #

Every year, window cleaners suffer injuries from slipping on soap or water and falling from large heights. We have a solution! For the Window Washer project, our task is to design and prototype a robot that can automatically clean one side of a plexiglass window without scratching or damaging the surface. As a team, we wish to create a compact robot that will be able to clean multiple adjacent windows effectively and efficiently. Intrigued? Keep reading to see how we are accomplishing our goals of saving window cleaners from workplace hazards!
